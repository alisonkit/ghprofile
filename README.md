# Hey there!

- 👋 Hi, I’m Kit
- 👀 I’m interested in creating art with open source tools, and optimizing my creative worflow with them. I would also like to learn how to make games.
- 🌱 I want to learn C, C++, Lua and Rust. I should learn Blender, Ardour and Godot as well.
- 💞️ I may not be a software developer, but if there's any way I can contribute to creating FOSS I'd love to in any way or form.
